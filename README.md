### Miscellaneous
- Price vs Market Cap
  - Use [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) to determine the size of a crypto, by market cap.
  - Do not just look at the price. But keep in mind that this is a common misconception which has been known to influence prices due to a sudden and large volume of new investors flocking.
- Currency vs Platform vs Utility
  - Crypto projects can generally be divided into these three categories:
    - Currency: Projects focused to be a medium of exchange.
    - Platform: Provide a blockchain and developer resources for other projects to build on top of.
    - Utility: Coins or tokens which are required to redeemed a service.
- ERC20 Tokens
  - ERC20 Tokens are a standard for tokens built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.
  - Many of the top 100 crypto projects by market cap are ERC20 tokens.
  - You should always be aware if your investment has its own blockchain vs leveraging Ethereum's blockchain
  - Most ERC20 tokens are utility tokens
- Whitepapers
  - Since Bitcoin, the tradition is to have an in-depth explainer of the project's technology in an academic-style whitepaper
  - Quality of whitepapers have fallen from pseudo-academic grade to business brochure
- General Strategy
  - Look at landing page, team, whitepaper, funding strategy
